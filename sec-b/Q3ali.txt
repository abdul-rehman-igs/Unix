Execute the following tasks:
a) Using the find command, search the '/usr/share' directory and display all the files (excluding directories).
b) Explain why the locate command may fail to find a file that you have just created or deleted.
What commands are required so that locate returns the correct results?

perform this:

a) find /usr/share -type f | head


b) locate uses a prebuilt database. It does not search live files. Therefore, newly created or deleted files may not appear.

example:
sudo updatedb
locate myfile.txt
